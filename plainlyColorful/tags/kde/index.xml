The service is designed to scale horizontally as well as to be resilient to components crashing or going crazy. In order to achieve this we have implemented a microservice architecure that communicate using a bus (rabbitmq{:target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;}) plus some other tricks so we can scale using commodity hardware horizontally.</description></item></channel></rss>
