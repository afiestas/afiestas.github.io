<p>Hi fellow users and developers, sooner than I thought, I have more things to share with you about KBluetooth, so let's go :)</p>
<p>Happens that month's ago <a title="Apol blog" href="http://www.proli.net/" target="_blank">Apol </a> lent me his Apple Wireless Keyboard so I can give support to it in KBluetooth. After small research I concluded that the keyboard wasn't standard, so I just pull it over. Then, a few days ago, Ereslibre was playing with a Gnome and I decided to try to pair the Apple keyboard using the Gnome Bluetooth System, and guess what... it worked !</p>
<p>So, today, I decided do not go to sleep until I got it working, and here I am, 03:12 and writting this entry with that keyboard :)<br />

This feature, should fix the keyboard pairing completely, not matter if your keyboard is the Apple one or not.</p>
<p>This feature will be available in the next version (0.5) together with a new Wizard and maybe a new (or at least improved) device manager.</p>
<p>If you can test your "non-working" keyboard with the trunk version and give me some feedback, I'll be very appreciated :)</p>
<p>Cya and Happy Hacking!</p>
