<p>Between all the hard work we're doing within the Solid community (Networking, XRandR, Power Management...) we always find time to release patch releases which usually fix small issues and help to ease the waiting until the next big release is done.  Now it is time for BlueDevil to have some patch releases.</p>

<div>One thing about 1.0.5, it is going to be the last 1.0.X version with new translations, that doesn't mean that we will stop giving support to it, thanks for our good codebase it is quite easy for us to maintain different releases, as you can see we've 3 bug fixes applied in both releases.</div>
</div>
<div>If you're a distribution maintainer is quite important that you consider upgrading to this new versions, main reason? i18n!</div>
