<p>Hi there! no, this post is not about Kbluetooth nor KTuberling or any development/technical stuff, is more a user-like post, so common! keep reading this time :)</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was in the office with ereslibre showing something to him (I don't remember what), when he noticed something in my desktop that he didn't liked, my fonts. I laughed quite a lot because I thought that it was a &quot;Yet Another Small Detail That Ereslibre Cares Of&quot;. I let him modify my settings so I could say later to him: you see? this thing has not improved my user experience in any way. But as you probably guessed by now, I was terribly wrong.</p>
<p>What's more, now I'm pushing everybody I know which uses KDE to setup the same configuration I have. I don't really know what the hell the parameters I modify means, but what I know is that now I'm happier with my desktop.</p>
<p>The famous settings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Font: Dejavu Sans</li>
<li>Use anti-aliasing: Enabled</li>
<li>(Click on configure)</li>
<li>Use sub-pixel rendering: RGB</li>
<li>Hinting style: Slight</li>
</ul>
<p>In screenshots (so you can extrapolate it to your language):</p>
<p><strong>Set the font and enable the anti-aliasing:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Click on configure and set the subpixel rendering:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Set the hinting styke:</strong></p>

<p>The last KDE user I &quot;moved&quot; to these settings has needed 1 day to notice the changes, so just do it and wait :)</p>
