<p>In the last few months, and specially the last few weeks there has been a lot of noise about Canonical, some of it sadly involving our own people. Since I have a bit of a relationship with Canonical and some of its employees I'd like to write some words about my PoV towards them. This is only my point of view, in no way it represents the thoughts of my employer or the KDE community.</p>
<p>First of all I'd like to say that I think Canonical is doing a poor job on being a good floss citizen in the ecosystem, or so we think. In a lot of statistics and numbers (like the amount of changes in the Linux kernel) people have shown over and over how Canonical is focusing on doing their thing and only working on those areas of their interest and basically not giving a **** about the rest. I can only agree with those numbers and with the statement that Canonical only works on those things that are of its interest. I also thing doing that is completely fair.</p>
<p>Canonical as any other company has invested resources in those areas they thought they needed special attention. Most people talk about the inside house, re-inventing the wheel cases such Unity (would have been awesome if they could have used KDE technology) or Mir where Canonical has just done a poor job, in some cases technically (Unity own toolkit, then switching to Qt, then dropping Qt, then adopting Qt again) or socially (Mir and the bullshit about Wayland they spread). My opinion on this projects goes close with the opinions stated by other members of KDE and the FLOSS ecosystem so I won't repeat it.</p>
<p>Canonical is not only Unity and Mir though, they also work in other variety of projects and they do so being a perfectly correct FLOSS citizens, contributing everything upstream and in some cases not requiring any CLA. This is a list of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>They work on <a href="http://bitmath.org/code/mtdev/" target="_blank">mtdev</a>, multi touch library used by many projects, including the driver I'm using to write this blogpost (mtrack)</li>
<li>Sponsor Alberto to work on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/accounts-sso/" target="_blank">accounts-sso </a>being the main contributors and NOT requiring any CLA.</li>
<li>Sponsors Ryan Lortie to work on a variety of things.</li>
<li>Fixes to Qt</li>
<li>Lots of work in Pulse Audio</li>
<li>Sponsor LightDM (with did not have CLA for a lot of time)</li>
<li>Upstart (it was good when it was created, now I think it needs to be replaced by systemd)</li>
<li>UDS (I went to 4 of them, they always paid my expenses and it was useful for Kubuntu and KDE)</li>
<li>Bazaar (another one that needs to go and be replaced by git... but eh it was good years ago)</li>
<li>For last, Ubuntu which was a healthy community driven project, at least until UDS stop happening.</li>
</ul>
