<p>Finally, the most wanted feature has landed in KBluetooth, support for Audio!</p>
<p>The support is divided in 4 blocks:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>Pair the device</strong><br />The support for pair the devices should be working, not only for HEADSETS but for everything.</li>
<li><strong>Connect to the service</strong><br />KBluetooth will detect if the paired device has audio service, and connect to it.</li>
<li><strong>Support for PulseAudio</strong><br />PulseAudio rocks, and since it rocks it will detect and configure the new device automagically :)</li>
<li><strong>Support for Alsa</strong><br />Alsa is not automagical like PulseAudio, so we've to write a few things in a file to get it working.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is done by KBluetooth but Alsa support, so I'll explain how to get it working manually.</p>
<p>1-Pair it using kbluetooth-wizard (be sure that you're using kbluetooth-wizard an not kbluetooth-<strong>input</strong>wizard)</p>
<p>2-Launch kbluetooth-devicemanager, click in your headset and write somewhere the Address (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)</p>
<p>3-Open with your favorite editor the file ~/.asoundrc (located in your home) and add:</p>
<blockquote><p>pcm.bluetooth {<br />type bluetooth<br />device 00:11:22:33:44:55<br />profile &quot;auto&quot;<br />}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4-If you want use it with Phonon, try the following configuration (is not working totally but something is something :))</p>
<blockquote><p>pcm.softvol {<br />type softvol<br />slave {<br />pcm &quot;bluetooth&quot;<br />}</p>
<p>control {<br />name &quot;SoftMaster&quot;<br />card 0<br />}<br />hint {<br />show on<br />description &quot;BlueTooth Headset&quot;<br />}<br />}<br />pcm.bluetooth {<br />type bluetooth<br />device 00:11:22:33:44:55<br />profile &quot;auto&quot;<br />}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this, a Bluetooth device should appear in KDE-Multimedia configuration, but as I said is not full working (If I recall correctly the output was working perfectly but not the input).</p>
<p>As always, the corresponding video:<br /><video width="600" height="350" controls="controls" tabindex="0" autobuffer="false" preload="metadata"><source type="video/ogg" src="http://cdn.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/audioandinput.ogv"></source></video> <a href='http://cdn.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/audioandinput.ogv'>Download video</a></p>
