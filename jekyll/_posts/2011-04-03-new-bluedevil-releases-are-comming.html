<p>In a few days we will be released the fourth "patch version" of our KDE Bluetooth stack together with the second "featured version" 1.1.</p>
<p>After that point, we will be changing our release policy to a "Release Soon Release Often", which is the natural next step since BlueDevil reaching maturity.</p>
<p>For the next days, I will try to make a post each day explaining the new features and changes in BlueDevil 1.1.</p>
<p>Cheers and Happy Hacking!</p>
