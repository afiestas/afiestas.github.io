<p>Hi there</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, BlueDevil RC4 is not out (yet), and there is a reason for that.</p>
<p>We're mainly 2 developers working on it, <a href="http://blog.ereslibre.es/" target="_self">ereslibre</a> and myself. Ereslibre is studying hard because he has like 5 exams in 2 weeks, and I'm looking for a new place to live downtown (still in Madrid), so those things are stealing our KDE hacking time :(</p>
<p>But don't worry, BlueDevil development is not paralyzed, luckily our company (ufocoders) is allowing us to work on BlueDevil all Fridays, and this is why we're moving the releases to that day.</p>
<p>The current TODO list until 1.0 final is:</p>
<ul>
<li>i18n</li>
<li>A few reported crashes</li>
<li>Better audio plugin</li>
<li>Documentation for distributions</li>
<li>Make kio_obexftp stable (this may involve a rewrite, or maybe wait until kde 4.5.2)</li>
<li>setup bluedevil.kde.org.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time, I'm not going to write a date, since we can't be sure to accomplish it, but we want to release the RC4 in 2 weeks more or less.</p>
<p>Cyap and sorry for the inconveniences!</p>
