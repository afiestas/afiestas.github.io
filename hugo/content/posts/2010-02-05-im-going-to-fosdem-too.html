title: I'm going to FOSDEM too!

---
<p>Seems that this year a lot of KDE hackers will go to FOSDEM and I won't be an exception :)!</p>
<p>I have not defined my roadmap (yet), but at least I'll have a couple of meeting regarding the future of KBluetooth, and sooner than you think I'll come back with great news about Bluetooth+KDE.</p>
<p>If you're in the FOSDEM and you have doubts or ideas about Bluetooth+KDE ping to me I'll be around *KDE* stuff in there.</p>
<p>cya!</p>
