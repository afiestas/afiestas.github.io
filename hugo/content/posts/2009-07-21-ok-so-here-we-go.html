title: Ok so, here we go!

<p>My name is Alejandro Fiestas, and I have a problem... I'm a addicted to the free software. People could ask, why? what the software libre give to you? I'm not sure but I've some theories :)<br />
The software libre gives to me the motivation I need to jump of the bed each morning thinking: come on Àlex! you've code to write! or come on Àlex, you've a community to help, to talk with, to work with! And is precisely the community my favorite point, is the power of the people, individual people which do things and  help others without expect anything material on exchange. Also, maybe the last thing, but less important is to be able to trouble big companies which do not respect any kind of freedom, not even in they own market using monopolistic strategies that makes almost impossible create your own company if you're not a millionaire.</p>
<p>Two long years have passed since Akademy-es Zaragoza, which was my first attended KDE event and something like 3 years since I left everything to start, what at this moment is my most important contribution to the free software ecosystem, eyeOS.</p>
<p>The eyeOS project, and the company behind  it, are like children for me, they're something stuck inside me and it won't never change. Despite it, a chain of incident put me in the situation of think about stop my collaboration with the eyeOS project, at least for a while, but this is something I haven't decided yet.<br />
My biggest challenge inside the project was (is?) build a community around it, and right now,  this objective have a low priority inside eyeOS, so I'm not sure if I want spend my time there. Technically, not even eyeOS 2.0 bring to me enough motivation.</p>
<p>So, in this situation, I need a source of motivation, a source I have found it in KDE. This project is amazing, the people inside are just fantastic (at the moment everybody inside the project has been cool with me helping me a lot, until the point that, Aleix Pol is reviewing this entry and is because of him that this entry won't have 900 errors/sentence.<br />
And  now, I'm trying to become one of them.</p>
<p>My road to become a KDE developer will be written in this blog along as other free software related stuff, and I hope, this can be useful for other people for not to have fear of anything related with floss, KDE is a project made of people, and almost in all cases, the people that works in a free software project, are good people :)</p>
<p>That's all, the next entry will be something more technical, will be one of my first steps in my kde path!</p>
