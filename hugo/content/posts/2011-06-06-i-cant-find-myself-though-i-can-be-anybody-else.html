<p>At the beginning of the Randa sprint (platform11, multimedia, kdevelop, nepomuk) we were given a badge so other people can see who we are and so on. One day (maybe two) after that, somebody started to exchange them until the point that I've been around 30different persons in 2 days xD.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started to look for myself again since I like to keep this things but seems that nobody has it :/ maybe somebody throw me to the trash? xD is impressive how small things like this can become incredibly funny when you're in this kind of events.</p>

<p>This is clearly not me :p<br />
