<p>Surprisingly everything is ready for the Solid Sprint that is going to take place in Madrid, we got 1Gb connection, 50&quot; flat screen, food, drinks, beer, coffee and of course a lot of code &quot;hungry&quot; :)</p></p>
<p>Sebas is already here to attend some KDE e.V stuff together with ereslibre (vice-president of KDE-España), we have had a good dinner (typical spanish bar) and now is time to sleep so tomorrow we can be with our hacker skills at 100%.</p></p>
<p>So, see you tomorrow!</p></p>
<p>PS: I wrote this post yesterday (Thursday).</p>
