<p><strong>First, a little bit of historyFirst, a little bit of history</strong></p>
<p>It Seems that was yesterday when a year ago in the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit, Victor sent a file to me through Bluetooth and kdebluetooth saved it in a hidden folder, the file is still there "~/.kbluetooth4/Vídeo003.3gp". That fact is what made me decide to use my spare time working on kdebluetooth.</p>
<p>After months of work in kbluetooth (the kdebluetooth fork I did), it started to work, but that spent hours made me realize that the kbluetooth never would be stable, it is a clear example of spaghetti code. Because of that, we started a new project called BlueDevil. If you're wondering about the name, Edulix came with it while working on the daemon, and it is based on PowerDevil (the name).</p>
<p>After a few fridays working on it, suddenly a Spanish company sent an email to me, asking for help to develop a Qt library to deal with BlueZ. A couple of emails (and beers) later, they hired us (ufocoders) to write the library, the first big step towards a real BlueDevil was done.</p>
<p>It's known that the best way to fully test a library is by using it a lot, so we started a negotiation to finance the development of BlueDevil, finally we got an agreement, we'll pay it 50% / 50%.</p>
<p>So, this is the boring history, that in my most humble opinion had to be written, now let's start with the review.</p>
<p><strong>KDE Config Module (system preferences)</strong><br />
The Bluetooth KCM allows you to configure all the options from a single place, it is divided in 3 pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Devices, allows you to switch on/off global KDE Platform Bluetooth integration, and manage your remote devices (add, rename, remove...)</li>
<li>File Transfer, allows you to switch on/off the reception of files, and configure where (by default) they will be saved once received.</li>
<li>Adapters, allows you to configure your adapters, changing the name, the visibility...</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BlueDevil Wizard:</strong><br />
The wizard allows you to pair with other bluetooth devices, and if they have compatible services connect to them. the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pair with any device</li>
<li>Connect to input service (mouse, keyboard, Wiimote)</li>
<li>Connect to audio service (headset, phones)</li>
<li>Powerfull "auto" PIN Mode, which has a database containing exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following video, you can see the pair+input connection done with a cellphone, which is used at the final to disconnect itself :p</p>

<p>In this one, you can see the connection of a Nokia Headset, and the integration with the system (kmix/phonon)</p>

<p><strong>Systray:</strong><br />
The systray is executed only if Bluetooth adapters are found, it allows you to do everything you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send files</li>
<li>Browse devices</li>
<li>Configure remote devices</li>
<li>Configure adapters</li>
<li>Configure file transfer</li>
<li>Add new remove devices</li>
<li>Connect to known devices services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>KDE Input/Output integration (KIO):</strong><br />
The KIO integration allows you to discover and browse your devices from your favorite file browser, the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover device</li>
<li>Show and configure (after clicking on them) the supported services.</li>
<li>If supported by the device, browse the files (copy, remove, create dir...)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>File reception:</strong><br />
Receive files from other devices is supported and totally integrated with the system (using notifications instead of blocking popups etc).</p>

<p>Finally, we'll be releasing one RC each week until we consider BlueDevil stable enough, so the next release will be Friday 4<br />
</br><br />
if you wish to help in the development of BlueDevil, you can contact us in irc.freenode.net #solid and in the kde-hardware-devel mailist.</p>
