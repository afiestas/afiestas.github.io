<p>At home!</p>
<p>After my "small" holidays in Paris, I'm back home. Despite my intentions of finishing some ktuberling/kamoso/kbluetooth work on this holidays</p>
<p>as you may have noticed I didn't, sorry for that :( I only had time to keep myself up to date with kde planet/mailist/commits, leaving only the last 3 days of kde activities as homework to when I'll come back.</p>
<p>So now, I've read everything I had to, as well as answering dozens of emails and I'm ready to hack on KDE again and to finish my kde homework's.</p>
<p>The first thing I'm going to do is to prepare the release of kbluetooth 0.4, as well as to write the property announcement of the project, which will be splited in 3/4 post.</p>
<p>Then some more work on Kamoso will follow (add webcam basic controls), and finally I have to finish the ktuberling patch.</p>
<p>That's all at the moment!.</p>
