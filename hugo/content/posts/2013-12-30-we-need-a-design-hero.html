title: We need a Design hero

---
<p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>The Solid team that I am member of, focuses on all things hardware, a few examples of our efforts are: Bluedevil, KScreen, kde-colord, powerdevil, libsolid, plasma-nm...</p>
<p>Since we are aware of how essential good hardware support is for having a good experience we try our best to deliver highly usable and simple interfaces that will enable any kind of user to unleash all the potential of their hardware. That is why usability is a top priority for us.</p>
<p>A few years ago something as simple as connecting into a wifi was a difficult and scary task to perform under our workspace, and most of the times it just did not work. Nowadays networking is not a problem any more, plasma-nm works reliably and we keep iterating on its design with the mission of having the most beautiful, clean and functional interface possible. And it is here <strong>we need your help</strong>.</p>
<p>We need some icons to be done for Plasma-nm that integrate with the current theme. We are aware that working for somebody else's theme is not a fun job but trust me, neither is most of the hardware work we do.</p>
<p>So, who is going to be our design hero? Who will work with us to bring networking to the next level?</p>
<p>If you want to <strong>help</strong>, please Contact <strong>Jan Grulich jgrulich at redhat dot com</strong></p>
