<p><strong>Chapter 0:</strong><br />
Everything started even before leaving home, Sunday 30 was the day when CEST timezone changes hour in order to do a better use of daylight so I set my alarm to 3 (the hour was being changed at that time) to be completely sure that I was doing it well (yes I'm a paranoid), for my surprise Android told me "Alarm will sound  in 4 hour" taking already into account the hour change.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1:</strong><br />
Plane take off was at 9:30 or something like that, so I decided to wake up at 5:45 since I like to make my baggage just before leaving (is the best way it works for me), at 6:30 I was on the street waiting for my taxi but guess what ? it never appeared. 15 min later I call the cab company and they tell me that the cab is scheduled for 7:30 (yay hour changing !), anyway they sent a new taxi and it arrived at 7:00, so officially I was behind my schedule though I kept calm, I do my schedules with enough time preventing that such things can happen so there was no reason for panic.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2:</strong><br />
After 30min of taxi drive I arrived to the airport, I do the checking in the machines and I headed to the "American Airline Security Check" to do the usual USA stuff. After the security check the nice lady tell's me "Oh, are you going to Orlando via Miami? you may want to check with my college since it is delayed and your connection flight should be rescheduled". I walk 2 meters and another nice lady explains to me that the flight has been delayed because of technical issues and that I should not worry because they will take care of everything, they actually did. The Madrid - Miami flight had a delay of 3 hours so they change my Orlando connection and they give me a voucher for a meal, didn't expect that so my first feeling was of gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3:<br />
</strong>Quickly after the re-scheduling I realized that I had 4,5 of waiting in the airport and the Barajas T4 is not known for having the best facilities for geeks, meaning that there are no power sources and no internet (not even paying). I started a migration through all restaurants trying to find one with power source, and know what ? I did ! Quickly enough, I ordered the breakfast menu and sat down in a edge of the restaurant with power source and comfortable chair, I was happy.<br />
My happiness didn't last much, after waking up my laptop and taking a bite of the horrible croissant I look for my standard usb-microusb cable and I hook it o my cellphone and later to my laptop, nothing happens. How many chances are out there that a simple usb cable will break just by putting it in a backpack ? I charged one of my cellphones with it the night before and it worked well... anyhow a breakfast without internet is not a breakfast anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong><br />
So, there I was stunning at the blue wallpaper of my shiny computer while taking another bite of that horrible croissant when I remembered a blurry image of an electronic shop not far from that restaurant eureka I thought! so these kind of shops are not completely useless after all. I left the "narutal orange juice" and the half eaten coissant in the table hoping that nobody will took that table and I ran to the shop to quickly buy the cable and come back before anybody take my precious power source. As you may guest when I came back the spot was already taken, it was 9:15 and I had 3 hours in front of me without internet without power source and with an almost empty stomach, don't ask me why but I decided to look for my gate I was tired of looking for power sources.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5:<br />
</strong>I started to walk through all the S</p>
