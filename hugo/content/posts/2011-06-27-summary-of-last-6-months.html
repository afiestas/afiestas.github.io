<p>More or less 6 months ago I put myself a list of objective to accomplish in KDE, so far these are the results:</p>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth: We've been working hard in the last release of BlueDevil (1.1), now we can say that more or less KDE has a good Bluetooth support :)!<strong><br />
</strong></li>
<li>Webcam: Kamoso 2.0 has been released, and with it rock solid support to do the basics such Take a picture, or Record a video.</li>
<li>﻿XRandR: The job has been started, I've in a private repository a fork of xrandrtray libraries, and the "configuration" has been decoupled from the actual XRandR code. More important I have a plan for it now.</li>
<li>LibSolid Async: Nothing on this area, -10 for me :(</li>
<li>Kevin Ottens former maintainer and overlord of Solid is transferring to me the responsibility, challenge accepted!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Zeroconf and Friends:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Samba has been fixed by rbelem (Rodrigo Belem), there is no place for me there :p</li>
<li>NFS support has been removed (by rbelem too), it has no place between modern user-land protocols.</li>
<li>UPnP: The work on UPnP is about to be merged, I haven't touch a line though I've read a lot about it.</li>
<li>Avahi: KDE Already has a good support for Avahi, though we've to improve how we present it to the user. No plans here and I won't be working on it anytime soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Almost nothing... Though I'm still willing to work on it starting by analyzing the current situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to say that I'm quite proud of myself though I haven't accomplish everything I wanted since right now my priority is my "real life" job.</p>
<p>Anyway, next post is going to be about what I'm going to do for the next 6 months... stay tuned!</p>
