title: BlueDevil 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 released

<p>Though we released the 1.2 version a while ago we decided to delay the announcement since there were some annoying bugs that now, thanks to the testing performed by the kubuntu community are fixed.</p>
<p>Relevant posts about BlueDevil 1.2 (with videos and pictures  :p):</p>

<div>For 1.1 branch there is only one fix that solve an annoying behavior when the wizard is invoked with pre-selected address and uuid (basically it was working behaving poorly, now it works well).</div>
<div>This is it for now, next thing to do is releasing 1.3 (aka the release that will fix all known crashes).</p>
</div>
<div>You can download them <a href="http://download.kde.org/download.php?url=stable/bluedevil/1.1.2/src/bluedevil-1.1.2.tar.bz2" target="_blank">here</a> (1.1.2) and <a href="http://download.kde.org/download.php?url=stable/bluedevil/1.2.1/src/bluedevil-1.2.1.tar.bz2" target="_blank">here</a> (1.2.1)</div>
<div>I hope you enjoy them !</p>
</div>
<div>Note: I forgot to public this post so the releases are actually a few weeks old, and we're about to release new ones in a few days :p</div>
