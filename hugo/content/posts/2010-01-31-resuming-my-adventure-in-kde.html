title: Resuming my adventure in KDE

---
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Is time to resume my adventure in the lands of KDE, I had to stop it because of work, I'm creating a new business together with ereslibre and edulix and we are kind of busy.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, in this second part of the adventure I'm not going to change my focus, so I'll continue hacking on kbluetooth, kamoso and ktuberling.</p>
<p>Here comes a small todo list I'll try to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish 0.4 release of KBluetooth (2 crashes to be fixed)</li>
<li>Release KBluetooth 0.5 (I'll talk about it in a other blog post).</li>
<li>Post at least once a week.</li>
<li>Start to develop the new Bluetooth solution for KDE.</li>
<li>Finish KTuberling easy switch.</li>
<li>Kamoso++</li>
<li>KTuberling++</li>
</ul>
<p>Something I'd like to hack on is the xrandr support, but I don't want to open more fronts not until at least I have kio_bluetooth working.</p>
<p>And well, this is all! I hope to blog in a few days announcing KBluetooth 0.4</p></p>
<p>Post written using Blogilo.</p>
