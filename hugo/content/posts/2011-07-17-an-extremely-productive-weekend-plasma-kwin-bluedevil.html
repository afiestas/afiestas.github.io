title: 'An extremely productive Weekend (Plasma, KWin, BlueDevil)'
---
<p>Is not a secret that the last few weeks (or even a month) I have been kind of unmotivated to work on KDE stuff, and that is a deal breaker to work on something you're not paid for and you do it only for the pleasure of doing it.</p>
<p>Though the reasons why I was unmotivated (or how I like to call it, kde-depressed) are still there, last Friday after finishing 3 important projects at work I felt again the adrenalin boost that makes me hack like crazy, no matter on what, but I have to hack on something. This is how one of my most productive weekends begun :p</p>
<p>The very same Friday at night I started hacking on some work stuff, nothing I can say here (because it doesn't matter at all) but I can assure you that my partners will be happy once they know :p</p>
<p>Saturday, I started to hack on KDE stuff and decided that instead of developing BlueDevil or Solid I was going to fix these small details that annoy me every day, and so far I fixed everything I wanted to fix:</p>
<p>Plasma:</p>
<p><a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/101968/">Panel auto-expand on XRandR events</a> (probably will go into 4.7)</p>
<p>KWin:</p>
<p><a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/101969/">Not let any window off screen on XRandR events</a> (This will have to wait until 4.7.1)</p>
<p>After fixing these two bugs was time to give some love to the old BlueDevil :p</p>
<p>BlueDevil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage, quite a trivial task but time consuming</li>
<li>Fixed bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277878">277878</a></li>
<li>Fixed bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277451">277451</a></li>
<li>Partial rewrite of kio_bluetooth (I will explain further in another post)</li>
<li>Fixed bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245538">245538</a></li>
<li>Fixed bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=253810">253810</a></li>
<li>Fixed bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277665">277665</a></li>
<li>Show only "connection title" in systray if there are more than one service to connect to</li>
</ul>
<p>That's for Saturday :p</p>
<p>Then today, Sunday I started the journey with some XRandR hacking, the plan to'em all is almost done and it will include a coulpe of fixes for 4.7.1 (though I'm not sure of it).</p>
<p>Aaand finally another bug fix of these small annoying things:</p>
<p><a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/101981/">Fix notification behavior</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now time to rest, who knows if tomorrow I will continue with this adrenaline boost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
