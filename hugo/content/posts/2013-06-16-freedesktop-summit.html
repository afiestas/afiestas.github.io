title: Freedesktop Summit

---
<p>A few days back I attended the first freedesktop summit/sprint where a few hackers from different free desktops met with the objective of working together. We were people from Razord-qt, GNOME, Unity and of course KDE.</p>
<p>Even though we did not had the chance to discuss all the topics I was specially interested in like Notifications or Session Inhibition I did had the chance to get involved in other topics that are equally interesting like the shared Desktop Files cache or the "Trash size cache" that will enable a cross desktop way of caching the size of the Trash folder getting better performance across desktops.</p>
<p>The social part of these kind of events is important as well, even though I already knew Ryan and David a week of working together makes the collaboration more smooth, and of course I also met new people as well like Lars, or Jeft.</p>
<p>I'm quite happy to have pushed together with Ryan this event, we definitively moved forward the collaboration between desktops and even though freedesktop is still far from being perfect I do believe we did a step into the right direction.</p>
<p>Can't wait for the next Fd.o Summit.</p>
