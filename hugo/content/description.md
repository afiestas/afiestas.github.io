I consider myself a Hacker, I have lot's of fun while working on different problems, not matter if they are computer based or not

I used to work a lot on free software stuff, these days though I play CTO at a startup

In this small corner of the internet I write my: findings, thoughts and musings just so I will not forget tomorrow
