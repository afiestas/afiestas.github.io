title: Nepomuk is not fast, is instant!
type: post
---
<p>Everybody that has been a KDE user for the last 2 years knows Nepomuk and its bad reputation, maybe it was desired in the past, but no more. This morning I decided to get my Nepomuk up and running again, and I have to say that it is impresive! just take a look at </br><a href="http://cdn.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/instantNepomuk.ogv">this video</a>:<br />
<video width="600" height="350" controls="controls" tabindex="0" autobuffer="false" preload="metadata"><br />
 <source type="video/ogg" src="http://cdn.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/instantNepomuk.ogv"></source></video><br />
The only thing I had to do is modify a kernel configuration, but I had to do it because my distributionb (ArchLinux) didn't for me, others like Ubuntu or OpenSuse have the correct value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Execute:<br />
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches<br />
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288</p></blockquote>
<p>If you get a value such 8000 then you have to change it, to do it:</p>
<blockquote><p>echo "fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288" &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf</p></blockquote>
<p>and restart.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm missing now is a good plasmoid (Crystal to the rescue?).</p>
<p>Update: I'm using trunk (4.6), but afaik Nepomuk should be as fast as in 4.5<br />
Dolphin searchbar is a feature found in 4.6 (to be released in 2 months)<br />
If you update the parameter using sysctl command remember to restart nepomuk.</p>
