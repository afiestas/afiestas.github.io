title: BlueDevil (stable) testing needed
type: post
---
<p>Hi there</p>
<p>Since we released 1.0, we've been working hard to stabilize BlueDevil as much as possible and after fixing a bunch of bugs in kio_obexftp, now it's turn for the wizard.</p>
<p>This is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Bluetooth 2.1 (SSP pairing)</li>
<li>Do not pair devices that don't need it</li>
<li>Better automatic mode (Updated PIN database)</li>
<li>Randomized the default PIN</li>
<li>Random PIN of 6 characters, shrink if needed (depending on device)</li>
<li>Improved the flow for lot of devices</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are plenty changes for a minor release and that's why we need some testing before release BlueDevil 1.0.2</p>
<p>This is already packaged in OpenSuse KDE:Unstable:Playground and to build it from the source you have to:</p>
<blockquote><p>git clone git://git.kde.org/bluedevil<br />
cd bluedevil<br />
git checkout stable<br />
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr (well this depends on your installation)<br />
make -j3 install (you will probably need root for this).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks!</p>
