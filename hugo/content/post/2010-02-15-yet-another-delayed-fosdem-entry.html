title: Yet Another Delayed FOSDEM Entry
type: post
---
<p>With a week of delay (almost) is time to write my sum up of FOSDEM, which by the way was my first one.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 05/02/2010:</strong></p>
<p>Wake up at 3:00 AM to take a cab to go to Barajas airport, I have to say that Gate 2 is uglier than the Gate 2 of El prat airport (and smaller), but one point in favor is that it was full of power sources :p</p>
<p>Once in Brussels, Kiko, Victor and Oscar were waiting for me, I got some stress because of the airport distribution, is like labyrinth! Then usual route in that kind of travels, Breakfast-&gt;Hotel-&gt;Launch-&gt;FOSDEM beer event. A well, between Launch and FOSDEM we went to Brussels MIDI to met Aleix pol (apol).</p>
<p>About the FOSDEM beer event, I'm not going to say anything new, lot of good beer, a lot of hackers around and good chat. Maybe I was expecting more free beer :(</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 06/02/2010:</strong></p>
<p>Mueheh perhaps because I was excited for my first FOSDEM, everything look wonderful to me, and one small detail I'm still enjoining was the way the donations were done: they gave us a receipt so it looked more like more official/serious.</p>
<p>Aleix pol has already blogged about kamoso appearing in the opensuse stand, it was a good surprise! (I can not image what the people of opensuse were thinking when apol and I started to laughing and taking pictures xD).</p>
<p>Something I found weird (and disappointed me) was that the Mandriva ppl didn't have any computer with KDE :/</p>
<p>About the talks, we were in KDE room almost all the day, so there's not much to say about.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday 07/02/2010:</strong></p>
<p>This day had a proper noun, Andrew_S._Tanenbaum, this is a short summary but it made my day. Another interesting thing was my chat with Will Stephenson about Bluetooth+KDE, I'm sure that what we discussed will have good effects in the KDE Bluetooth world.</p>
<p>Small note for future FOSDEM newbies: wearing a t-shirt of a project in which you are not involved IS NOT A GOOD IDEA! the people will think that you're a developer of it and will start to ask you a lot of questions xD!</p>
<p>Mental note: Next year bring KDE t-shirts.<a href="https://cdn.afiestas.org/posts/2010/02/DSC04604.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large  wp-image-130" title="Vintage Brussels" src="https://cdn.afiestas.org/posts/2010/02/DSC04604-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="869" /></a></p>
