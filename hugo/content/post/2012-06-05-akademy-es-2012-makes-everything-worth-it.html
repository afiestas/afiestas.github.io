title: Akademy-es 2012, makes everything worth it
type: post

<p>Most of you know me because of all the work I do on KDE in form of code: Kamoso, BlueDevil, Solid... It is the stuff I put on my blog so if you know my involvement in KDE because of my blog it is normal.</p>
<p>Besides writing code, I'm starting to be involved in other areas all across our community, one of them is KDE-España.</p>
<p>KDE-España is the legal representation of KDE in Spain, you can consider it as a sister of KDE e.V but only for the local community. One of the activities we do is the Akademy-es, a gathering of users and developers that happens every year in a different city of the country, so far we have had: Barcelona, Saragossa, Coruña, Bilbao, Barcelona, Saragossa (again :p) and sure more to come.</p>
<p>You may think these events are less important than writing software and that I shouldn't waste my time there. I say you are <strong>wrong </strong>and that at least they are equally important.</p>
<p>As a personal note, for me it is becoming one of the events I wait the entire year to attend even if it is only to see the group of friends I only see in that conference.</p>
<p>So I'd like to encourage you to organize Akademy's or smaller events on whatever city/country you live in, building a strong local community is crucial for keeping this global ship alive.</p>
