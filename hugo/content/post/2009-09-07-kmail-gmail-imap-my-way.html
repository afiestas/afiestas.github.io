title: KMail + GMail + IMAP, My way
type: post
---
<p>Hi everybody</p>
<p>Since KDE 3, a lot of people have wondered why KMail is so "slow" when using GMail+IMAP (IMAP alone always has worked for me). The main question was, where the problem comes from? KMail? GMail? both? My answer to this question is from KMail but with some clarify.</p>
<p>Is a known issue that KMail is not the best IMAP client, having some deep architectural problems as <a title="Thomas talk about kmail2" href="http://www.geeksoc.org/gcds/Thomas%20McGuire,%20KMail%202.ogv" target="_blank">Thomas explain to us in the gcds </a>.Anyway, it's working well for normal people, with normal I mean people that are not subscribed to 40 mailist, which receive 400emails/day and some folders may contain more than 30000 messages. So where exactly the problem is (imho) ? the problem is with the hardcore users like us,  which have thousands and thousands of emails, and is there where KMail is really slow :(. If that wasn't enough, GMail by default sends the emails duplicated or even triplicated. So you can imagine how slow everything will be with that configuration :D.</p>
<p>Small preamble of my history in this *aventura*<br />
I tried to use GMail + IMAP at least 8 times, without a success but since we've an explendit support for POP3 I just continued using it and being happy :D. But a day, I bought a new cell phone called HTC Magic, which what his best feature is his integration with google. So I wanted my email available in both devices, and not only this, I wanted it with they status synchronized. You can imagine what I needed to do that, IMAP! So I started to search my path to the KMail+GMail+IMAP happiness.</p>
<p>Well, stop writing bullshit and start with the howto.</p>
