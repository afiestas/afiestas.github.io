title: KBluetooth 0.4.1
type: post
---
<p>In 0.4 release I asked to the distributions to update they packages, some of them did and some of then not, but the best of all is that I got a lot of feedback from the packagers, and here comes the payment for that feedback :)</p>
<p>With the last release I added a crash when receiving files, I gare say it was not my fault, the KBluetooth code is a mess and I can't fix it without rewrite it from scratch (thing that I'll explain hopefully in 2 days).</p>
<p>Small roadmap for 0.4 version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix file transfer jobs (speed calculation and notifications)</li>
<li>Check (and re-check again) input</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to get the above points covered in a couple of days too.</p>
