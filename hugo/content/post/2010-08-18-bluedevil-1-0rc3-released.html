title: BlueDevil 1.0rc3 released
type: post
---
<p>This release has been delayed 1 week (as you can see) because we didn't had anything to release (no commits, no fixes), sorry for that! vacations are in the middle :)</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huge improvement on systray application stability, should not crash anymore</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the Wizard</li>
<li>Fixed some small bugs in the KCM</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Errata:</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at the error list in: <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=bluedevil">KDE Bugtrack</a></p>
<p>Also, this release is not ready to work on i18n, it is expected in RC4 (finally!)</p>
<p><strong>Download:</strong></p>
<p>The tarball can be found <a href="http://cdn.afiestas.org/files/bluedevil-v1.0rc3.tgz" title="BlueDevil 1.0rc3">here</a> with md5: 918d123aa7239fcc42a87fc3e3b418bd</p>
<p>And git tag: git clone git://gitorious.org/bluedevil/bluedevil.git; cd bluedevil; git checkout v1.0-rc3</p>
<p>Please, as always test BlueDevil as much as possible so we can fix the majority of the bugs before the final release.</p>
<p>Next release: 2010/08/25 (next week).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
