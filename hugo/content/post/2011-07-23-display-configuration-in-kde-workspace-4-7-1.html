title: Display Configuration in KDE-Workspace 4.7.1
type: post
---
<p>In my way home from work, talking with <a href="http://blog.ereslibre.es/" title="Ereslibre's blog" target="_blank">ereslibre</a> we concluded that would be awesome if I could fix the current "KRandR" code before starting to work on new one. With the "<a href="http://www.afiestas.org/an-extremely-productive-weekend-plasma-kwin-bluedevil/" target="_blank">adrenaline boost</a>" still in my blood I sat down and started to work on it.</p>
<p>After a few days of working, I'm pleased to announce that for KDE-Workspace 4.7.1 the "Screen/Display/Whatever configuration" has been hugely improve, all bug fix though but now it even seems to work!</p>
<p>The bugs I've fixed are hard to explain with words but I'm going to try anyway:</p>
<p>KRandRTray:</p>
<ul>
<li>Won't react on external changes (won't force its configuration)</li>
<li>Will update the menu (If you remove the VGA cable, VGA won't appear)</li>
<li>Will show disconnected outputs as disconnected in the popup)</li>
</ul>
<div>Configuration Dialog (KCM):</div>
<ul>
<li>"Unify Output" option has been added (aka you will get always the expected behavior)</li>
<li>Preview/Options will update on external changes</li>
</ul>
<div>Maybe I 'm forgetting something... but more or less that's it.</div>
<div>And like almost always, the mandatory video explaining the bug fixes, comparing KDE Workspace 4.6.5 and 4.7.1:</div>

<div>I hope you like it, and stay tuned if you're interested on "XRandR" support, because more is to come.</div>
