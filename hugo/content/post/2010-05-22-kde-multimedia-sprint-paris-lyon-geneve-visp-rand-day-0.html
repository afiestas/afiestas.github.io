<p>The train network in the middle of Europe is awesome, but by awesome I mean really awesome :D you can travel from almost all big cities without using the plane, which is by far more comfortable and green than doing it.</p>
<p>To reach Randa we had to take 4 trains, that can be painful in some countries (in Spain for example) but in Switzerland the trains have an atomic precision so you don't even need to know the name of the station where you have to "leave", when you buy the ticket they'll give to you a paper with the schedule, so you only have to be careful with the time :)</p>
<p>So, after that 6/7h of traveling we arrived to Randa, where a bunch of KDE hackers were waiting for us :p</p>
<p>The town is beautiful, it remembers me to the Heidi Manga (which was inspired by that kind of towns), maybe it is the most beautiful town I ever saw.</p>

<p>In the travel between Geneve and Visp we stop in Lausanne, the city where my mother was born :p</p>
