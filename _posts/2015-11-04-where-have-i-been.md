> I can't imagine anything worse than waking up every morning without any energy for going to work.

The first time I heard that statement I was 17 and it made an impression on me. It made me think of how we use
our limited time, which roughly is: 1/3 sleeping, 1/3 at work and 1/3 at what we call spare time. We can't control how much
we need to sleep, but we can take a stance on the other two thirds (work and spare time).

And this is the reason behind my disappearance, my job at BlueSystems was not fun anymore and every project I mantained at KDE
felt more like a chore than anything else. After a month of not jumping out of the bed to head to work it was time to move on.
So I passed maintainership to the people that were actually doing the job (special mention to David) and I quit my job as a full
time KDE hacker.

Nowadays I am working at a company called eyeOS, but more on that in the next post :)

I appreciate all the people that have been asking how I have been during this last year, my apologies for disappeararing without
notice.

Cheers!







======================================================================================
A few days ago (2nd of November) I celebrated my birthday and many fellow KDE developers wished me, thank you everyone!
Some of them asked me where am I hiding these days, which is a fair question I also sometimes get when hanging on IRC or in real life. I think
you deserve an explanation!

The first boss I ever had once told me: There shouldn't be anything tougher than waking up every day and thinking, what a bummer
I have to go to work. That made an impression on me. We spend a third of our life at work and another third asleep. You can't control how much you need to sleep but you indeed can control whether you are happy or not at your job!

Ever since, if I have not been happy with my job during an entire month I would resign. It is not worth it and luckly enough I can
afford it. And this is what happend to me around a year back, my job at BlueSystems working full time on KDE was not fun anymore, the
maintainership of every project I lead felt like a chore, I was no longer jumping out of bed to go to work... It was time for a change.
