<p>As maybe you have noticed I'm kinda offline these days, this is because I'm in Paris in some sort of holidays. While I'm here my internet/code hours will be reduced to the mornings, from 10:00 to 14:00 (local hour), I'm using the rest of the day for walking trough those beautiful streets.</p>
<p>Well, this is it at the moment,  tomorrow I'll announce something in this blog, something that lot of people has been waiting for :p</p>
