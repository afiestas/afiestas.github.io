<p>In my last post "<a href="http://www.afiestas.org/demand-a-kde-experience-from-your-distribution/" target="_blank">Demand a KDE Experience</a>" one of the most discussed points was patches, what do we do with them? You might not know but I have been working really close with the Kubuntu team during the last 2years, one of my tasks as the upstream was reviewing all the patches they had in Qt/KDE packages. From that experience and from what I remember these is  a list of the most common types of patches you can find applied on our software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Distribution integration
<ol>
<li>Patches to install extra software (codecs, flash, etc)</li>
<li>Things related to the Package System</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Rejected features upstream</li>
<li>Backports</li>
<li>Workdaroundsruse</li>
</ol>
