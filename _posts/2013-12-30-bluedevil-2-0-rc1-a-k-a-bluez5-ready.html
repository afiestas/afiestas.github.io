<p>After months of discontinued work we are happy to announce BlueDevil 2.0 !</p>
<p>The 2.0 version brings the same experience we can find in the 1.X series but using the new BlueZ5 stack which at least on our testing improves a lot the general stability and specially on sending/receiving/sharing files via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>In this major version we have focused on rapidly adopting the new technology so we don't have many changes visible to the user, we have added though a few things we hope you will like.</p>
<p>All parts of BlueDevil are now more aware of multiple adapters, wizard, bluetooth:// (kio) and system tray are some examples.</p>

<p>The Wizard is now more intelligent than before, it will connect to the right profile automatically making the setup of Mouse, Keyboard and Headsets more pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong><br />
We need a lot of testing! This is major change for BlueDevil and even though we have done our best to make sure the first release is free of bugs it will be a miracle if that's true!</p>
<p>Fill bugs at <a href="http://bugs.kde.org" target="_blank">http://bugs.kde.org</a> under Solid/bluetooth version 2.0-rc1, it is important that you set the version since 2.X bugs will be given more priority.</p>
<p>Finally I'd like to thank Daniel Schaal who did most of the work in libbluedevil and ported other bits in the applications.</p>
