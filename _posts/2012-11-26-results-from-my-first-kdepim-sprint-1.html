<p>A few weeks ago I went to Berlin, this time to attend the October KDEPIM sprint.</p>
<p>Though I have met some PIM hackers through the years I have been around KDE, I never had the opportunity to actually work with them, and try to figure things out, and as it is usual in our community they haven't disappointed me.</p>
<p>I had 2 objectives for this sprint, first get a few bugs that I discover while working on WebAccounts fixed, and secondly try to track down all the KMail issues I have when I run it in my laptop. In this blog post I will only cover the first block.</p>
<p><strong>Collections that can't be de/activated</strong></p>
<p>This is a really stupid bug, but in my humble opinion these are the kind of things that makes the user feel that they are using inferior quality software.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the following pic, you will see how there is a checkbox left of my email address that apparently will activate or deactivate all the contact groups provided by my Google account, well it doesn't do anything so clicking on it results on basically nothing.</p>

<p>I tried to fix it and successfully tracked the bug down to a piece of code, but I needed help from the PIM hackers to actually fix it, and of course they didn't disappointed, in a matter of hours it was fixed :)</p>
<p><strong>KMail and the "Broken" imap resource</strong></p>
<p>Just after a new IMAP resource was added (doesn't matter if from KMail or Kontact or any other method) a notification will appear saying that the IMAP resource is broken. Wait what? is it broken? if I have just added it!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone aligncenter" title="KMAil broken notification" src="http://www.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/notification.png" alt="" width="465" height="104" /></p>
<p>Well, not this is fixed since KMail now knows how to differentiate between a broken IMAP resource and one that has not been yet configured.</p>
<p><strong>Activate resources when added</strong></p>
<p>Another small bug or behavior that really bothers me is that when a new resource is added (for example a Google account is configured), the new added Calendars or Agendas won't be "activated/checked" by default. I think that if you just added something is because you want to use it, don't you think?</p>
<p>Well, this problem may seem simple but it isn't, so after taking a look at it with the PIM hackers we thought a good way to fix it, though we didn't had time to fix it.</p>

<p>If nobody does, I will try to fix it when possible.</p>
<p>See you in part 2!</p>
