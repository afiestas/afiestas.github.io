<p>I'm not a fussy user, I mean I don't really care so much about interfaces or usability (as an user of course, as a developer I try to do my best), wherever there is a terminal I feel like home in there. However, in the other hand, when I'm developing I need to feel comfortable with the environment, including the application I'm developing. It's for this reason that I've prioritized the GUI polishing of the wizard (the old one pissed me off every time I had to test something).</p>
<p>And well, this is the result, a freezeeless interface for KBluetooth-wizard.</p>

<p>PS: As a sneak-peak, notice that the wizard is not longer called "inputwizard :)"</p>
<p>Saluts!</p>
