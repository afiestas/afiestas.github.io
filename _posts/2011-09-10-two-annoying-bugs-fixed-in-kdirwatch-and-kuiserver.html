<p>Just a quick announce for the interested parties (distributions and advanced users).</p>
<p>Yesterday I pushed a couple of fixes that fix annoying bugs and because of that I belive that you may want to backport them to 4.6.5 or even to 4.7.1 if you don't want or you can't wait until 4.7.2.</p>
<p><strong>Folder contents are not refreshing:</strong></p>
<p>This happens only when using a kernel with two digits uname such 3.0-ARCH for example, commit to backport is:  kdelibs <em>7df5a79fb9f09e4a4a80cd541cc478b5fa6df00f</em></p>
<p><strong>Empty jobs:</strong></p>
<p>Some times jobs are shown empty though the job itself is working fine, this happen in a random situation depending on the system load etc, it was no easily reproducible but thanks to my slow and lovely computer I could then I fix it.</p>
<p>commits to backport are two in kde-runtime: <em>329a4fe6fe7b8a9262d5ef7fefba255e9c29fade</em> and <em>d769c74a5cab576e124666174a0b2bc5e2af8cde</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two fixes will be released with 4.7.2.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
