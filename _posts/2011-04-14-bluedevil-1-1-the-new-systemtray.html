<p>With the 1.1 BlueDevil version, the system tray has been improved adding new features as well of revising the usability, this is the new aspect:</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="302" caption="BlueDevil 1.1 system tray"]<img title="BlueDEvil 1.1 system tray" src="http://cdn.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bluedevil_systemtray.png" alt="BlueDevil 1.1 system tray" width="302" height="293" />[/caption]</p>
<p>And this is the old 1.0 system tray:</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="299" caption="BlueDevil 1.0 system tray"]<img title="BlueDevil 1.0 system tray" src="http://cdn.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bluedevil_old_systemtray.png" alt="BlueDevil 1.0 system tray" width="299" height="315" />[/caption]</p>
<p>A few changes can be notice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most common actions have been placed at the top and at the bottom</li>
<li>The configuration action have been merged to just "Configure Bluetooth"</li>
<li>The list of known devices is homogenous with no separator between types</li>
<li>Active/Disable discoverable mode has been added</li>
<li>Added "Turn off" for</li>
<li>Small overlay icon indicating that at least there is one device connected</li>
<li>Tooltip (not visible at the screenshot) indicating if there is any activity</li>
</ul>
<p>We're now quite happy with our most important interface, its usage is fast and it is feature complete, because of that no new changes are expected, though we may work on a plasmoid to replace it, but that is at least for +2 versions.</p>
<p>And, here it is the mandatory video:<br />
