<p>Motivated by KWin and KDE Telepathy I started to clean the list of bugs related to Solid (Bluetooth, Network, Disks, Screens...) with the objective of making bugzilla an efficient tool to use for the team. During that process I have realized how important is to do proper bug triaging not only for the team itself but for the entire community.</p>
<p>I believe that from the moment we accept feedback on the software we release (bugs in this case)</p>
