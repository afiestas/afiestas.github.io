<p>Hi there</p>
<p>Even if we don't want to, our brains need to rest, they need to disconnect from everything and break with the routine of every day, and this is for what the holidays are for.</p>
<p>So tomorrow my actual vacations start, I will be in Paris (again :p) having some family time for a week. I will be online on irc/jabber and I will try read my email everyday but do not expect a quick answer.</p>
<p>At the airports/planes I will probably give some love to Kamoso, with a bit of luck we can do a release some time soon.</p></p>
<p>See you!</p>
<p>Ps: My next entries will be boring things about my vacations, so be ready for that :)</p>
