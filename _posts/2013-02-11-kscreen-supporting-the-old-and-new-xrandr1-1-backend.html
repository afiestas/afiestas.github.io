<p>One of the points we had left to implement before we can consider KScreen a replacement for the current  screen management was support fo XRandR 1.1.</p>
<p>The XRandR1.1 extension dates from 100B.C and it only knows about one screen on which you can change: size,  refresh and rotation. Luckily all modern drivers implement at least XRandR 1.2 (which know about multiple screens) so you may be wondering why do we bother to support such an old thing?</p>
<p>It turns out that virtualization software usually only support XRandR1.1 and some other tools like Xvnc or Xephyr do as well, so the only way of ensuring that we look good when executed in those software is by implementing support for this old api.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what impression will a potential user get if the first thing we do while executed in a Virtualbox is crashing? not good for sure.</p>
<p>So, we are a step closer to consider ourselves complete :)</p>
<p>Cheers !</p>
