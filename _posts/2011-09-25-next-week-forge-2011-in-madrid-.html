<p>So, just like that a year has passed and we're gathering again in our offices to enjoy the annual Solid sprint also known as Forge.</p>
<p>A lot of things happened since last year, while last year we had to organize ourselves to finally support the new stack (UDisk, UPower, U...) this year all of that is done and stable,</p>
