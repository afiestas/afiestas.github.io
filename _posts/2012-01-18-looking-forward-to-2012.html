<p>I'm sure 2012 is going to be an amazing year for Free Software and of course for the KDE community, a lot is happening within our community and we have just started the year ! Just to mention a few from the top of my mind: Calligra getting closer, Plasma Active2, 4.8 release, Frameworks 5, OwnCloud 3, Spark... I can go on for a while :) As every six month or so, here is the list of what I'm planing to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>AppMenu KRunner (you will see it tomorrow)</li>
<li>Finish <a href="http://community.kde.org/Solid/Projects/DisplayManagement/Design">new RandR supoprt </a></li>
<li>libsolid in Frameworks5</li>
<li>BlueDevil 3.0</li>
<li>Kamoso-QML</li>
<li>Community work on Solid</li>
<li>Community work on KDE-España</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to get all finished before <a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">Akademy-2012</a> and with a little bit of luck be able to work on more stuff. I promise, next post will be my "usual" post with pictures and videos :P!</p>
