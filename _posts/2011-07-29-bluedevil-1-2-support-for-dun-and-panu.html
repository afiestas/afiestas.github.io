<p>Nobody seems to have found the eastergg.. so I won't be giving away the N950 I wanted to... (ah, I forgot to say that? xD)</p>
<p>So, the easteregg was a small Network icon showing up in Dolphin at 03:02 :) which in BlueDevil 1.2 will allow you to launch the DUN or PANU configuration.</p>
<p>While I'm writing this post, only DUN support is implemented since I don't have a device that support PANU, but don't worry as I say in the following video support for PANU will be implemented in a few days, it is just a couple string replaces.</p>
<p>Mandatory video:</p>

<video width="600" height="350" controls="controls" tabindex="0"><br />

</video><br> <a href="http://www.afiestas.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/network.ogv">Direct Link</a></p>
<p>Hope you like it, and see you in the next blog post!</p>
