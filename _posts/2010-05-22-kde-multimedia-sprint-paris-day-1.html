<p>In my way to Randa where the Multimedia Sprint will take place I'm doing a stop in my brothers house, among the obvious reasons (see my brother) I'm here because the overall price of the travel was 20€ cheaper and because I love &quot;Nutella crepes&quot; :)</p>
<p>In the plane I have been working on QuickSand (the KRunner alternative interface), basically what I'm doing is to remove the hardcoded colors so that it can be used on any kind of colors scheme (I'm using a dark one right now).</p>
<p>When I finish the fine tuning I'll public a small video about QuickSand, I'm not going to add any new features but I think it is an interesting unknown part of the desktop.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
