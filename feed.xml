<p>In 2013 I bought a Macbook Pro 13” which came with a HiDPI display (also known as retina display). Already back then the support for
a single HiDPI display was quite alright with KDE4 and a few tweaks here and there. Months later Qt5 got native HiDPI support and most
applications switched from GTK2 to GTK3 and finally the outliers (chromium based apps, godot, arduino…) got support for higher DPIs as well.</p>

<p>This would have meant perfect support for HiDPI on linux already in 2015 or so but we are missing one important thing which is supporting
both HiDPI and normal DPI screens at the same time. In order to support HiDPI screens applications need to render themselves bigger than
they used to, how much bigger depends on the screen pixel density which, for example, in the case of my laptop is from 1.75 to 2 times
bigger.</p>

<p>This means that applications rendered for HiDPI look huge on normal screens:</p>

<p>Here is where the internet seems to tell you that there is nothing to do but wait until Wayland arrives and saves us all
(I can’t wait for that btw) but that’s actually not true, X can do it.</p>

<p>XRandR allows us to apply transformations on the outputs, like for example rotation, and it also allows us to scale the screens.
Scaling the screens means that X will virtually increase the amount of pixels available in the display and automatically adapt the final
image size to the actual output resolution. For example:</p>

<p>If a 2x2 scale transformation is applied to a 1920x1080 screen it will be seen as a 3840x2160 screen by the applications but X will magically cut that in half before sending
the image to the monitor. So we have effectively turned our normal density screen into HiDPI.</p>

<p>This is an example of how the xrandr command line looks like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xrandr --output eDP1 --auto --output DP1 --auto --scale 2x2 --right-of eDP1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will set DP1 to the default mode, scale it by 2 and place it at the right of the HiDPI laptop screen (eDP1).</p>

<p><em>Wow</em>! <em>Awesome</em>! This is so cool! Why is everybody not doing this? Where is the catch? <br />
Mostly because of one bug: <br />
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39949">https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39949</a></p>

<p>If you read through the bug entry you will find a <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=94929" target="_blank">patch</a> created by Chris Wilson in 2014
which is shipped by default in some distributions but it has never been integrated into master.</p>

<p>If your distribution doesn’t ship with this patch by default (good for them!) you can build your own xorg-server, the patch should apply until 1.18 and for 1.19
you have a ported version <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afiestas/xorg-server-patches/master/cursor.patch" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although with this patch the experience is already way better since the applications will look correctly on all screens Qt has a few bugs
that will create weird glitches specially by placing windows where they don’t belong.</p>

<p><br />
I have been working on 3 patches that solve most of these at least in my day to day use.</p>

<p>These two still need to be reviewed and might not get accepted: <br />
<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/182207/" target="_blank">https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/182207/</a> <br />
<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/182392/" target="_blank">https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/182392/</a></p>

<p>This one seems to be on track to be merged (Drag and Drop): <br />
<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/182391/" target="_blank">https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/182391/</a></p>

<p>With all this patches the HiDPI experience in any modern Linux distro is as good as in macOS and the best part is that we do not have to wait until Wayland.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;login&quot;=&gt;&quot;afiestas&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;afiestas@kde.org&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;afiestas&quot;, &quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Àlex&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Fiestas&quot;}</name><email>afiestas@kde.org</email></author><category term="Software Libre" /><category term="KDE" /><category term="Linux" /><category term="Desktop" /><category term="kde" /><category term="software libre" /><category term="linux" /><category term="desktop" /><category term="hidpi" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">open365, let’s declare war at Google and Microsoft</title><link href="http://afiestas.org/open365-lets-declare-war-at-microsoft-and-google/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="open365, let’s declare war at Google and Microsoft" /><published>2016-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-04-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://afiestas.org/open365-lets-declare-war-at-microsoft-and-google</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://afiestas.org/open365-lets-declare-war-at-microsoft-and-google/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://open365.io/" target="_blank">Open365</a> is a public and/or private cloud designed to compete with the likes
of Google Drive or Office365 by leveraging all the best free software out there.</p>

<p>The service is designed to scale horizontally as well as to be resilient to components crashing or going crazy. In
order to achieve this we have implemented a microservice architecure that communicate using a bus (<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com" target="_blank">rabbitmq</a>) plus some
other tricks so we can scale using commodity hardware horizontally. Nothing fancy, nothing revolutionary but it had to
be done :)</p>

<p>Finally, we’ve integrated under the same system very well know software solutions for File sinchronization,
PIM (Email, calendar,contacts…) and office.</p>

<p>The public service is in open beta so you can go to <a href="https://open365.io/" target="_blank">Open365</a> and try it out for free.</p>

<p>As I write this blogpost we are working hard to release all the code as <strong>free software</strong>. There is a lot to be done before we can
release all the code such as: creating a simple installer, preparing documentation and accomodating the new repositories to our CI.</p>

<p>We expect to release everything within days, but it will be done when it is done :)</p>

  <p>I can’t imagine anything worse than waking up every morning without any energy for going to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first time I heard that statement I was 17 and it made an impression on me. It made me think of how we use
our limited time, which roughly is: 1/3 sleeping, 1/3 at work and 1/3 at what we call spare time. We can’t control how much
we need to sleep, but we can take a stance on the other two thirds (work and spare time).</p>

<p>And this is the reason behind my disappearance, my job at BlueSystems was not fun anymore and every project I mantained at KDE
felt more like a chore than anything else. After a month of not jumping out of the bed to head to work it was time to move on.
So I passed maintainership to the people that were actually doing the job (special mention to David) and I quit my job as a full
time KDE hacker.</p>

<p>Nowadays I am working at a company called eyeOS, but more on that in the next post :)</p>

<p>I appreciate all the people that have been asking how I have been during this last year, my apologies for disappeararing without
notice.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;login&quot;=&gt;&quot;afiestas&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;afiestas@kde.org&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;afiestas&quot;, &quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Àlex&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Fiestas&quot;}</name><email>afiestas@kde.org</email></author><category term="Software Libre" /><category term="KDE" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can’t imagine anything worse than waking up every morning without any energy for going to work.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">For community free of Trolls</title><link href="http://afiestas.org/for-community-free-of-trolls/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="For community free of Trolls" /><published>2014-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://afiestas.org/for-community-free-of-trolls</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://afiestas.org/for-community-free-of-trolls/"><![CDATA[<p>In light of the last comments containing insults and other attacks to members of our community I have decided to make a video blog explaining my thoughts on the issue.</p>

<p>When I am using my tablet or phone though the situation changes. I find myself rarely using the browser, in fact I only use it to visit some site I saw on another app like Twitter or Facebook.<br />

<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>Both web and android apps are way better at managing content than we are.</p>
<p>They always have something to show to you: perhaps something new that might interest you? perhaps a bold guess based on you previous search? or perhaps just what is "hot" nearby? Two of the best example are Youtube and Spotify.</p>

<p>Sharing content is damn easy on both either by copying the url on the Web or by clicking the omnipresent share button in Android. As a matter of fact I don't remember the last time I shared a picture or an article using a desktop app... Probably it was really long ago.</p>
<p>They know what content you like... They know your habits... They know everything and they use it to provide the most convenient content at all time. Oh look! It is Monday, perhaps you want to watch the new video uploaded in this Youtube channel as you do every week?</p>
<p>Finally, both web and Android apps try to avoid making the user think too much which I find it to be a relief when I am using them. Again they do this by knowing what content you are interested on and by providing it to you in the best possible way.</p>

<p>The 2.0 version brings the same experience we can find in the 1.X series but using the new BlueZ5 stack which at least on our testing improves a lot the general stability and specially on sending/receiving/sharing files via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>In this major version we have focused on rapidly adopting the new technology so we don't have many changes visible to the user, we have added though a few things we hope you will like.</p>
<p>All parts of BlueDevil are now more aware of multiple adapters, wizard, bluetooth:// (kio) and system tray are some examples.</p>

<p>The Wizard is now more intelligent than before, it will connect to the right profile automatically making the setup of Mouse, Keyboard and Headsets more pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong><br />
We need a lot of testing! This is major change for BlueDevil and even though we have done our best to make sure the first release is free of bugs it will be a miracle if that's true!</p>
<p>Fill bugs at <a href="http://bugs.kde.org" target="_blank">http://bugs.kde.org</a> under Solid/bluetooth version 2.0-rc1, it is important that you set the version since 2.X bugs will be given more priority.</p>

<p>The Solid team that I am member of, focuses on all things hardware, a few examples of our efforts are: Bluedevil, KScreen, kde-colord, powerdevil, libsolid, plasma-nm...</p>
<p>Since we are aware of how essential good hardware support is for having a good experience we try our best to deliver highly usable and simple interfaces that will enable any kind of user to unleash all the potential of their hardware. That is why usability is a top priority for us.</p>
<p>A few years ago something as simple as connecting into a wifi was a difficult and scary task to perform under our workspace, and most of the times it just did not work. Nowadays networking is not a problem any more, plasma-nm works reliably and we keep iterating on its design with the mission of having the most beautiful, clean and functional interface possible. And it is here <strong>we need your help</strong>.</p>
<p>We need some icons to be done for Plasma-nm that integrate with the current theme. We are aware that working for somebody else's theme is not a fun job but trust me, neither is most of the hardware work we do.</p>
<p>So, who is going to be our design hero? Who will work with us to bring networking to the next level?</p>
<p>If you want to <strong>help</strong>, please Contact <strong>Jan Grulich jgrulich at redhat dot com</strong></p>

<p>We decided to go this early (4 days before the actual sprint starts) because we all have to work on things with somebody close to the Brno RedHat office in a variety of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on PowerDevil for Plasma2 (at least Lukáš and I)</li>
<li>Moving KScreen forward, fixing bugs etc (Dan and I)</li>
<li>KDE Startup (Martin K, David, Martin B and I)</li>
<li>KDE Telepathy (David and Martin K)</li>
<li>KPeople (Vishesh, Martin K, David)</li>
<li>Metadata system (Vishesh and Dan)</li>
<li>Login manager (David and Martin B)</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't noticed, all those things have nothing to do with PIM! So it is a perfect time to introduce a new concept in KDE, the pre-sprint hackathons !</p>
<p>Even though I hate being on the road, I can't wait to arrive to Brno and start this week, I'm sure it is going to be ton of fun and a lot of new things will come out of it.</p>
